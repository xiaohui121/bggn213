Load our data files

``` r
counts <- read.csv("GSE37704_featurecounts.csv", row.names = 1)
metadata <- read.csv("GSE37704_metadata.csv", row.names = 1)
```

> Q. Complete the code below to remove the troublesome first column from
> countData

``` r
#Note we need to remove the odd first $length col
counts <- as.matrix(counts[,-1])
```

This looks better but there are lots of zero entries in there so let’s
get rid of them as we have no data for these.

> Q. Complete the code below to filter countData to exclude genes
> (i.e. rows) where we have 0 read count across all samples
> (i.e. columns).

``` r
counts <- counts[rowSums(counts) != 0 ,]
head(counts)
```

### Volcano plot

Now we will make a volcano plot, a commonly produced visualization from
this type of data that we introduced last day. Basically it’s a plot of
log2 fold change vs -log adjusted p-value.

``` r
plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj) )
```

![](class15_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

> Q. Improve this plot by completing the below code, which adds color
> and axis labels

``` r
# Make a color vector for all genes
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res) )

# Color red the genes with absolute fold change above 2
mycols[ abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ] <- "red"

# Color blue those with adjusted p-value less than 0.01
#  and absolute fold change more than 2
inds <- ((res$padj)<0.01 & (abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ))
mycols[ inds ] <- "blue"

plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col=mycols, xlab="Log2(FoldChange)", ylab="-Log(P-value)" )
abline(v=c(-2,2), col="black", lty=2)
abline(h=-log(0.1), col="black", lty=2)
```

### Adding gene annotation

Since we mapped and counted against the Ensembl annotation, our results
only have information about Ensembl gene IDs. However, our pathway
analysis downstream will use KEGG pathways, and genes in KEGG pathways
are annotated with Entrez gene IDs. So lets add them as we did the last
day.

> Q. Use the mapIDs() function multiple times to add SYMBOL, ENTREZID
> and GENENAME annotation to our results by completing the code below.

``` r
library("AnnotationDbi")

The main gage() function requires a named vector of fold changes, where
the names of the values are the Entrez gene IDs.

``` r
foldchanges  <-  res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

Now, let’s process our results a bit more to automagicaly pull out the
top 5 upregulated pathways, then further process that just to get the
pathway IDs needed by the `pathview()` function. We’ll use these KEGG
pathway IDs for pathview plotting below.

``` r
## Focus on top 5 upregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

## Section 3. Gene Ontology (GO)

Again we will use **gage()** but this time with GO genesets rather than
KEGG

``` r
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)

# Focus on Biological Process subset of GO
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets, same.dir=TRUE)

lapply(gobpres, head)
```
